# GTA: SA Savegame Extractor (for Android)

This is an Android application intended to be used with [the savegame editor](https://github.com/gtasa-savegame-editor/gtasa-savegame-editor) to add the ability to edit Android savegames.

The application searches for savegame editors in the local network (WiFi) and has the ability to send savegames created with GTA: San Andreas for Android to the editor where they can be edited.

**NOTE:** This is currently in what you can call pre alpha and requires an [unreleased version](https://github.com/gtasa-savegame-editor/gtasa-savegame-editor/) of the savegame editor to work.
