# GTA: SA Savegame Extractor (for Android)

This is an application that finds local GTA San Andreas savegames and can send them to a [savegame editor](https://github.com/gtasa-savegame-editor/gtasa-savegame-editor) instance running in the local network using mDNS.

**NOTE:** This is currently in what you can call pre alpha and requires an [unreleased version](https://github.com/gtasa-savegame-editor/savegame-extractor-android) of the savegame editor to work.
